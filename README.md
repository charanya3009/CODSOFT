### TASK 1- IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

### Introduction

The Iris flower dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the machine learning community. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This project aims to build a classifier that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on these measurements.

### Features

- Utilizes Python for building the Iris flower classifier.
- Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification.
- Implements data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task.
- Allows for custom prediction inputs.

### Installation

To run the Iris flower classifier, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
